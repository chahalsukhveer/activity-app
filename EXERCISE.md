## Add activity selector (https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#the-select-tag)
* Add folder activity-selector inside src and add Functional component named ActivitySelector.

* Create select input with predefined options 

```const ACTIVITIES = ['Running','Cycling','Yoga','Meditation'];```

* UI style for the component is as below

```
<div className="row">
    <div className="col-md-6"></div>
    <div className="col-md-6">
        <form>
            Add your code here
        </form>
    </div>    
</div>
```
* Hint : use Array.map to navigate through options.
* Use react hook useState to pass name of selected activity
